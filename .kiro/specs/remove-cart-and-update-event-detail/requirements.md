# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves two main objectives: removing the shopping cart functionality from the entire application and updating the EventDetail.tsx page to match the style and layout of ScreenDetail.tsx for a consistent user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Shopping Cart Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have a streamlined experience without shopping cart functionality, so that I can focus on direct purchasing without the complexity of cart management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate through the application THEN I SHALL NOT see any cart-related UI elements (cart icon, cart drawer, cart notifications)
2. WHEN I interact with screens or events THEN I SHALL NOT see "Add to Cart" buttons or similar cart-related actions
3. WHEN I view the navigation THEN I SHALL NOT see the cart icon in the navigation bar
4. WHEN I use the application THEN I SHALL NOT receive cart-related notifications
5. WHEN I inspect the codebase THEN I SHALL NOT find any unused cart-related code, imports, or dependencies
6. WHEN I view screen cards or event cards THEN I SHALL see direct purchase/booking actions instead of cart actions
7. WHEN I interact with the application THEN I SHALL NOT encounter any cart-related errors or broken functionality

### Requirement 2: Update EventDetail Layout and Style

**User Story:** As a user, I want the EventDetail page to have the same look and feel as the ScreenDetail page, so that I have a consistent and familiar experience across different types of content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the EventDetail page THEN I SHALL see a layout structure similar to ScreenDetail with proper responsive design
2. WHEN I navigate the EventDetail page THEN I SHALL see a sticky navigation header similar to ScreenDetail
3. WHEN I view EventDetail on mobile THEN I SHALL see the same responsive behavior as ScreenDetail
4. WHEN I interact with the EventDetail page THEN I SHALL see consistent button styles, spacing, and typography matching ScreenDetail
5. WHEN I view the EventDetail page THEN I SHALL see a similar sidebar layout for purchase options (desktop) and mobile-optimized purchase flow
6. WHEN I scroll through EventDetail THEN I SHALL see consistent section organization and visual hierarchy matching ScreenDetail
7. WHEN I view EventDetail THEN I SHALL see the same color scheme, shadows, and visual effects as ScreenDetail
8. WHEN I interact with purchase options in EventDetail THEN I SHALL see a similar user flow and modal system as ScreenDetail
9. WHEN I view EventDetail THEN I SHALL see consistent header structure with back button, title, and action buttons matching ScreenDetail style
10. WHEN I use EventDetail on different screen sizes THEN I SHALL see the same responsive breakpoints and mobile adaptations as ScreenDetail

### Requirement 3: Maintain Existing Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing functionality (except cart) to continue working properly after the changes, so that I can still use the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I purchase screens THEN I SHALL still be able to complete the purchase flow without cart functionality
2. WHEN I purchase event moments THEN I SHALL still be able to complete the booking flow without cart functionality
3. WHEN I navigate the application THEN I SHALL NOT experience any broken links or missing functionality
4. WHEN I use the application THEN I SHALL see all existing features working properly except cart-related ones
5. WHEN I view screens or events THEN I SHALL still see all relevant information and purchase options
6. WHEN I interact with the application THEN I SHALL NOT see any console errors related to removed cart functionality
